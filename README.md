# My projects
This repository contains a portfolio of Data Science projects completed by me for academic and self learning purposes. Most of them are presented 
in the form of Jupyter Notebooks but there are also some written in R language. 
I have used different Python libraries like: Panda, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy, Scipy
                  and R libraries like: dplyr, ggplot2, readr, tidyr and corplot
to perform Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Hypothes Testing and some Machine Learning Algorithms. 

If you like my work and want to have a chat about the portfolio or work opportunities, drop me an email at: ssanalab@gmail.com
